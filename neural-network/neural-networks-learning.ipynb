    "* Given a training example $(x^{(t)}, y^{(t)})$, we will first run a “forward pass” to compute all the activations throughout the network, including the output value of the hypothesis $h_{\\Theta}(x)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "For an `output node`, we can directly measure the difference between the network’s activation and the true target value, and use that to define $δ_j^{(3)}$ (since layer 3 is the output layer). For the `hidden units`, you will compute $δ^{(l)}_j$ based on a weighted average of the error terms of the nodes in layer $(l + 1)$."
